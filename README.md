*Design news and inspiration.*

Foshizzle is an extension of [plaid](https://www.github/nickbutcher/plaid) and it is a showcase of [material design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/). It pulls in news & inspiration from 
[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) & [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/). It demonstrates
the use of
[material principles](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-principles)
to create tactile, bold, understandable UIs.

**[Install on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.foshizzle)**

##### To-Dos
* Update to Kotlin and Modern Android Architecture views as per Plaid v2.0
* Support multiple providers e.g. Behance
* Provide opinionated **architecture/testing** advice; it utilizes vanilla Android components. For advice on this, I'd recommend [Blueprints](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture).
